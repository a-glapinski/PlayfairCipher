On 26 May, it will be 20 years since Manchester United completed a remarkable Treble - becoming the only team to win the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League in one season.
The club are marking the achievement by hosting a Champions League final rematch against Bayern Munich at Old Trafford, and will also be paying tribute on next season's kit.
Yet, such are the fine margins between success and failure that United's Treble hopes were almost killed off before the players seriously started to think it was possible.
Six weeks before finally completing their hat-trick of titles - Premier League, FA Cup and European Cup - Sir Alex Ferguson's side were playing major rivals Arsenal in an FA Cup semi-final replay at Villa Park.
Reduced to 10 men following the dismissal of captain Roy Keane, they were locked at 1-1 when Arsenal were awarded a penalty in the second minute of injury time.
Dennis Bergkamp prepared to take it. Up to that point in his Gunners career, the Dutchman had taken six penalties - and scored every one.
"When it was given, I honestly thought there were still about 10 minutes left," says United keeper Peter Schmeichel. "That's how the game had been. Two teams battling it out, just equal, nothing between them. In the end, at the highest, highest level, it is one stroke of luck that separates you."
Facing that penalty, Schmeichel had nothing to help him but his instincts and his agility. Contrast that with Ben Foster's situation 10 years later when United beat Tottenham on penalties to win the League Cup. On that Wembley day in 2009, United keeper Foster was shown footage on an iPod of where Spurs' players liked to put their spot-kicks.
Back in 1999 at Villa Park, Schmeichel was on his own. He went low to his left. The guess was correct.
"I had done no research," admits the Dane. "The save was pure luck. I'm glad we didn't have iPods in those days. Who knows what would have happened if there had been?"
